  <p>I am a highly motivated full stack developer with over 15 years of experience designing Web-based
software applications.  I bring a unique set of skills to making sense of our cultural heritage.  My key interest is in
the design and creation of of tools that help us explore the relationships and patterns among data that only computers can help us discover.  My Bachelor’s degree has given me a deep understanding of the history and practice of art and design, while years
of programming practice, a Master in Library and Information Science, and ten years experience of full stack development for academic libraries, have left me with an ideal skill set for supporting Digital Humanities scholarship.  </p>
