summary: "This post is intended as a follow-up to my post called Personal User Interfaces. In that article I talked about how animating through code is often frustrating because of the lack of instant feedback due to the abstract nature of programming, and came up with a quick and dirty UI to help me animate a constellation.  I this article I introduce a more robust UI, that can be reused for a variety of purposes."

If you've ever seen Bret Victor's [Inventing on Principle talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII) (or any of his talks, really) then you will know about the challenges of designing with code.  In general, the abstraction of code can be a huge barrier to people who may otherwise be inclined towards interface design as a vocation. In my last post, I spoke about Personal User Interfaces as a way of bridging that abstraction gap.  I even designed a quick-and-dirty interface for creating "kinetic constellations" with the GreenSock JavaScript Library.  Well, this is an update to say that I have been working towards more reusable UI's in the form of composable web components.  Not only did I use this more refined UI for a library book locator project, but I was also able to use it to create a [more stable UI for creating "kinetic constellations"](http://sdellis.com/svg-draw-component/examples/gif.html) and taught others to use it to create their own animations at [EdUI 2016](http://eduiconf.org/sessions/javascript-animation/).  Here's an animation I made at that workshop:

Can you guess who it is?
