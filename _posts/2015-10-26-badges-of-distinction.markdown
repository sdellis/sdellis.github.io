Code4Lib has been putting on conferences for over a decade, and this year I have the opportunity to be one of the key organizers.  The popularity of the annual conference has grown every year, and we expect to max out at 450 attendees this year. What is unique about Code4Lib is that there is no organization.  There is no leadership or hierarchy.  There is no "headquarters" or geographical ties.  There is no legal entity.  It's just a name that refers to a widely distributed group of people -- a large and ever expanding group of people -- who are interested in open source technology solutions to library, museum, and archives problems. Any effort that is expended on Code4Lib is 100% volunteer driven.  In short, Code4Lib is an anarchy, in the best sense of the word.

And while I find it amazing that we continue to put on great conferences, publish an academic journal, and serve as a kind of technical help-desk for our peers, this lack of structure has made it increasingly challenging for conference organizers.  One of the big problems is that we can't pay for stuff on our own.  We depend on finding a fiscal host each year to sign contracts and make up-front payments.  We also depend on sponsors to help keep the registration costs down, and make the conference experience as enjoyable as possible.  Up until recently we depended on volunteers to host our conference website.

We are incredibly grateful to the folks at Oregon State University (OSU) who have been volunteering for over ten years to host our site, but the downside is that they have day jobs just like the rest of us.  As a result, Code4Lib comes no where close to a priority among all the demands of anyone's employer.  As any web developer knows, no public-facing app is ever safe from security threats, updates, patches, and just plain old evolving trends and standards that make a site feel relevant.  This poses a problem because a distributed community cannot have a single point of failure.  We cannot put the kind folks at OSU in the position of subservience to the group.  At the same time, we need to move forward, and it's hard to get sponsors for a technology conference when the looks and performs in a way that was cutting edge ten years ago.

A redesign was in order.  Our goals were to:

* Empower all members of the community to contribute to the development and content of the site
* Bring the performance, design, and user experience up to date
* Gather structured data in the way of proposals, testimonials, even gatherings.
* Use the code4lib.org domain to add authority to the site
* Host the site for free
* Get as many sponsors as possible

The old wiki had an organic navigation that simply did not work for a conference
